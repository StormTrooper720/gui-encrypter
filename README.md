# Python GUI Encrypter
A python encrypter and decrypter using fernet and tkinter. By using fernet, the program uses a key to encrypt and decrypt. Without the key, a file cannot be encrypted and decrypted. I would say that this program is very secure.
## Use
run the main.pyw file to run. You can also use the non gui version by running each file yourself.
